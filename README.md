# airflow
This project is a learning exercise for understanding and working with Apache Airflow. It focuses on writing DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) to automate workflows.

## Project Structure
The project directory `/Users/nash/Project/airflow` contains the following files:

1. `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project and its purpose.
2. `dags/`: This directory contains the DAG files. Each DAG represents a workflow and defines the tasks and their dependencies.
3. `plugins/`: This directory is used for custom Airflow plugins, such as operators, sensors, and hooks.
4. `requirements.txt`: This file lists the Python dependencies required for running the project.
5. `config/`: This directory holds the configuration files for Airflow, including the `airflow.cfg` file.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Install Apache Airflow by running `pip install apache-airflow`.
2. Set up the Airflow environment by configuring the `airflow.cfg` file in the `config/` directory.
3. Create your DAGs in the `dags/` directory. Each DAG file should define the tasks and their dependencies.
4. Run the Airflow scheduler and web server to start executing and monitoring your DAGs.
